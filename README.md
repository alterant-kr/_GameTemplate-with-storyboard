_GameTemplate-with-storyboard
=================================

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/)

ORIGINAL TEMPLATE FROM Radamanthus Batnag
Corona Game Template version 1.0

This is a template project for building games using Ansca Mobile's Corona SDK (http://www.anscamobile.com/corona/)

CHANGES
- This code incorporates with Director class by  Ricardo Rauber rather using storyboard in Corona SDK
- Get rid of line of Director class from CREDIT

USAGE
Out of the box, this is a working Corona project. It includes a splash screen (splash.lua, displays res/splash_screen.png for 1 second) and the following menu buttons:
- Play
- Settings
- Help
- About

Note the naming convention for button images: play.png is the button for Play, settings.png for Settings, etc.

The project directory structure follows my personal convention for projects:

appname
  +-- assets
  +-- appname
  +-- doc

- All code is in appname/appname.
- Game assets (e.g. Illustrator .ai files) are in appname/assets, finished PNGs are copied over to appname/appname because that's where Corona SDK expects them to be.
- The game design document (yes you should have one) and all other documentation are in appname/doc

CREDITS

The code includes some code adopted from the Ghosts vs. Monsters project by Beebe Games (http://blog.anscamobile.com/2010/12/ghosts-vs-monsters-open-source-game-in-corona-sdk/)
